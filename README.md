# weather-report-dashboard
Tools & Technologies Used: Data Source: Weather API Software (for collecting live and historical data) Data Visualization & Modeling: Power BI Data Analysis Expressions (DAX): Used for calculations, KPIs, and custom metrics# weather-report-dashboard To analyze and visualize real-time and historical weather conditions across four different cities. The goal is to understand temperature trends, humidity variations, and weather patterns for better comparison and forecasting.

Project Workflow: Data Collection: Extracted city-wise weather data through the Weather API. Data Cleaning: Prepared and structured the data for Power BI integration. Modeling: Designed relationships and created DAX measures for analysis. Visualization: Developed interactive dashboards showing temperature, humidity, wind speed, and city-wise comparison.

Accuracy Achieved: 100% data accuracy â€” verified with API source readings and time stamps.

Output: Developed a Power BI dashboard displaying visual insights for four cities. Generated comparative graphs and performance indicators for weather conditions.

Key Insights: Clear visualization of temperature trends across regions. Easy comparison of daily humidity and weather patterns. Actionable insights for planning, travel, and data forecasting.
